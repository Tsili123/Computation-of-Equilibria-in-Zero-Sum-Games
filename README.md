# MSc in AI Demokritos Multiagent Agent Reinforcement Learning Assignment

Fictitious play and Q-Learning was examined for the computation of equiilibria in Zero-Sum games. We tested convergence to Nash-Equilibria in several two-player(two agents) games, which are matching pennis, rock-paper-scissors and selling damaged goods. Regarding the approach that was followed, we tested fictitious play agent vs fictitious play agent(FP vs FP), Q-Learning agent vs Q-Learning agent(Q-Learning vs Q-Learning) and Fictitious play agent vs Q-Learning agent(FP vs Q-Learning). 

The report is included [here](https://github.com/Tsili123/Computation-of-Equilibria-in-Zero-Sum-Games/blob/main/ReportAgents_mtn2323.pdf).
